# Skills & Training Background

## Training history
I have trained with a personal trainer before.
Past training sessions are stored as YAML files in the `gym-data/` folder.

When creating plans or workouts:
- Analyze those YAML files to understand my training volume, intensity, and exercise selection
- Use them as historical context, not strict rules
- Prefer continuity over novelty unless there is a clear benefit

## Strength training (learned exercises)
I am familiar and comfortable performing the following exercises:

- Deadlift
- Bench Press
- Single-Arm Dumbbell Row
- Barbell Row

These exercises do not require technical re-teaching.

## Endurance & conditioning
- Swimming: I currently practice swimming at least once per week
- Running: I am starting to run (easy pace, beginner-level volume)

## Mobility
- No known mobility limitations
- Full range of motion in major joints
- Mobility work is welcome but not restrictive
